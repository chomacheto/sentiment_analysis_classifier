# Sentiment Analysis Classifier UI/UX Specification

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Sentiment Analysis Classifier's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Power User - Aspiring Data Scientists & NLP Practitioners:**
Technical professionals (CS students, bootcamp graduates, career changers) with 2-5 years programming experience who need advanced features, model comparison capabilities, and educational depth. They prioritize learning modern NLP techniques while building portfolio pieces that demonstrate production-ready skills to employers.

**Casual User - Small Business Owners & Product Managers:**
Non-technical professionals (product managers, marketing professionals, small business owners) who need simple, automated sentiment analysis without extensive technical setup. They prioritize clear results interpretation, cost-effective solutions, and business decision-making support over technical depth.

**Administrator - Technical Decision Makers:**
System managers and technical leads who need oversight capabilities, performance monitoring, and deployment control. They require comprehensive analytics, system health monitoring, and the ability to manage API access and usage patterns.

### Usability Goals

1. **Ease of learning:** New users can complete basic sentiment analysis within 2 minutes of first visit
2. **Efficiency of use:** Power users can compare multiple models and export results with minimal clicks (< 5 interactions)
3. **Error prevention:** Clear validation and confirmation for model selection, batch uploads, and API configurations
4. **Memorability:** Infrequent users can return and navigate core features without relearning interface patterns
5. **Educational value:** Technical users understand attention mechanisms and model differences through interactive visualizations
6. **Production readiness:** Interface demonstrates enterprise-quality design suitable for portfolio presentations and interviews

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Prioritize clear communication of AI predictions and confidence levels over aesthetic innovation
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Start with simple text input, reveal advanced features (model comparison, explainability) as users explore
3. **Consistent patterns** - Use familiar UI patterns throughout the application while maintaining professional SaaS aesthetic
4. **Immediate feedback** - Every analysis request shows real-time progress and provides instant visual results
5. **Accessible by default** - Design for all users from the start with WCAG AA compliance and inclusive design principles
