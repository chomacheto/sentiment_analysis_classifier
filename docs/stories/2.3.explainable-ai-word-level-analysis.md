## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2 completion [Source: docs/stories/2.2.confidence-visualization-and-metrics.md]:
- Professional Streamlit web interface successfully implemented with custom CSS styling
- Existing SentimentDisplay component already provides basic confidence visualization
- UI components package structure established in `packages/ui_components/`
- Integration with existing sentiment pipeline from previous stories maintained
- Test coverage achieved 99% for web interface components
- Responsive design properly implemented for desktop and mobile browsers
- Session state management already implemented for prediction history
- Export functionality already available for CSV and other formats

### Data Models
Based on Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]:
- **SentimentAnalysis Model**: Web interface must display sentiment_label, confidence_score, processing_time_ms
- **Model Confidence Data**: Pipeline returns `model_confidence` array with scores for all sentiment classes
- **Attention Data**: Need to extend sentiment pipeline to return attention weights for each token
- **Word-Level Analysis**: New data structure needed for word-level attention scores and contribution rankings
- **Export Format**: Extend existing CSV export to include attention visualization data

### API Specifications
Based on API Specification [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]:
- Web interface will consume the sentiment pipeline directly (not through REST API yet)
- Use existing Pydantic models for input validation from `packages/ml-core/validators.py`
- Maintain consistency with error handling patterns established in previous stories
- Follow established logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Extend sentiment pipeline to return attention weights and word-level analysis

### Component Specifications
Based on Components [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]:
- **Frontend Web Component**: Primary responsibility for this story - enhance existing Streamlit interface
- **Technology**: Streamlit 1.28+, Custom CSS, Tailwind CSS 3.3+
- **ML Inference Engine Component**: Must extend existing sentiment_pipeline.py to include attention extraction
- **UI Components**: Create new components in packages/ui_components for attention visualization
- **State Management**: Use Streamlit Session State for attention analysis and comparison data

### File Locations
Based on Unified Project Structure [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Main App**: Enhance existing `apps/web/app.py` with new attention components
- **UI Components**: Create new components in `packages/ui_components/` directory
  - Create `attention_visualization.py` for word-level attention heatmaps
  - Create `attention_comparison.py` for comparison mode
  - Create `technical_explanation.py` for educational content
  - Create `visualization_export.py` for screenshot/export functionality
- **ML Core**: Extend existing `packages/ml-core/sentiment_pipeline.py` to include attention extraction
- **Configuration**: Use existing `packages/ml-core/config.py`
- **Testing**: Create new `tests/test_attention_visualization.py` for attention components
- **Styling**: Use existing `apps/web/static/styles.css` and enhance as needed

### Testing Requirements
Based on Testing Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual attention visualization components
- **Integration Tests**: Test attention extraction from sentiment pipeline
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete attention analysis workflow
- **Coverage Target**: >90% for new attention components
- **Testing Tools**: Pytest, Streamlit Testing, FastAPI TestClient

### Technical Constraints
Based on Tech Stack [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Frontend Framework**: Streamlit 1.28+ with custom CSS and Tailwind CSS 3.3+
- **ML Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers for attention extraction
- **State Management**: Streamlit Session State for attention data persistence
- **Export Formats**: PNG, PDF for visualizations, CSV for data
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-2-second response time for attention analysis
- **Responsive Design**: Support desktop and mobile browsers (≥320px width)

### Project Structure Notes
- All new attention components must follow existing UI component patterns established in packages/ui_components/
- Attention extraction must integrate seamlessly with existing sentiment pipeline architecture
- Export functionality should extend existing CSV export capabilities
- Responsive design must maintain consistency with existing web interface components
- Session state management should integrate with existing prediction history functionality
