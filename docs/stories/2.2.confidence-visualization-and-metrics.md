## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 completion [Source: docs/stories/2.1.streamlit-web-interface-foundation.md]:
- Professional Streamlit web interface successfully implemented with custom CSS styling
- Existing SentimentDisplay component already provides basic confidence visualization
- UI components package structure established in `packages/ui_components/`
- Integration with existing sentiment pipeline from previous stories maintained
- Test coverage achieved 99% for web interface components
- Responsive design properly implemented for desktop and mobile browsers

### Data Models
Based on Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]:
- **SentimentAnalysis Model**: Web interface must display sentiment_label, confidence_score, processing_time_ms
- **Model Confidence Data**: Pipeline returns `model_confidence` array with scores for all sentiment classes
- **Historical Tracking**: Need to store prediction history in session state with timestamps
- **Export Format**: CSV export must include id, text_input, sentiment_label, confidence_score, model_used, processing_time_ms, created_at

### API Specifications
Based on API Specification [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]:
- Web interface will consume the sentiment pipeline directly (not through REST API yet)
- Use existing Pydantic models for input validation from `packages/ml-core/validators.py`
- Maintain consistency with error handling patterns established in previous stories
- Follow established logging and monitoring infrastructure

### Component Specifications
Based on Components [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]:
- **Frontend Web Component**: Primary responsibility for this story - enhance existing Streamlit interface
- **Technology**: Streamlit 1.28+, Custom CSS, Tailwind CSS 3.3+
- **ML Inference Engine Component**: Must integrate with existing sentiment_pipeline.py
- **UI Components**: Enhance existing components in packages/ui_components for confidence visualization
- **State Management**: Use Streamlit Session State for prediction history and statistics

### File Locations
Based on Unified Project Structure [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Main App**: Enhance existing `apps/web/app.py` with new components
- **UI Components**: Enhance existing `packages/ui_components/` directory
  - Enhance `sentiment_display.py` with new confidence features
  - Create `confidence_metrics.py` for detailed visualization
  - Create `prediction_history.py` for tracking
  - Create `statistics_panel.py` for metrics
- **Integration**: Must use existing `packages/ml-core/sentiment_pipeline.py`
- **Configuration**: Use existing `packages/ml-core/config.py`
- **Testing**: Enhance existing `tests/test_web_interface.py` with new component tests
- **Styling**: Use existing `apps/web/static/styles.css` and enhance as needed

### Testing Requirements
Based on Testing Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for core functionality (maintain existing high coverage)
- **Testing Pyramid**: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- **Testing Tools**: Pytest, Streamlit Testing, Playwright for E2E
- **Test Location**: Enhance existing `tests/` directory at project root
- **Frontend Testing**: Use Streamlit Testing framework for component testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for complete user workflow testing including new features

### Technical Constraints
Based on existing implementation [Source: packages/ui_components/sentiment_display.py]:
- **Existing Confidence Features**: Basic confidence meter and percentage already implemented
- **Color Scheme**: Use existing sentiment color mapping (green/red/yellow)
- **Responsive Design**: Maintain existing responsive design patterns
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-2-second inference time from existing pipeline
- **Session State**: Use Streamlit session state for prediction history (not persistent storage)

### Project Structure Notes
The confidence visualization enhancements should be implemented in the existing `apps/web/` directory following the established project structure. All new components must integrate seamlessly with the existing sentiment pipeline and maintain consistency with the established architecture. The interface should follow the microservices approach outlined in the high-level architecture, enabling future integration with the REST API and other components.

## Testing
- Test file location: Enhance existing `tests/test_web_interface.py`
- Test standards: >90% coverage for core functionality (maintain existing high coverage)
- Testing frameworks: Pytest, Streamlit Testing, Playwright for E2E
- Testing pyramid: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- Focus on new confidence visualization components, historical tracking, and export functionality
- Test user interactions, data persistence, and cross-browser compatibility for new features
