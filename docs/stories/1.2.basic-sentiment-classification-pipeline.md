# Story 1.2: Basic Sentiment Classification Pipeline

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** data scientist,  
**I want** a working sentiment classification pipeline using pre-trained BERT models,  
**so that** I can classify text sentiment with minimal code and validate the core functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hugging Face pipeline implemented for sentiment classification using DistilBERT model
2. Function accepts text input and returns sentiment label (positive/negative/neutral) with confidence score
3. Basic input validation and error handling for edge cases (empty text, very long text)
4. Model downloads and caches automatically on first run
5. Processing time for single text input is under 2 seconds on standard hardware
6. Unit tests verify correct sentiment prediction for sample positive, negative, and neutral texts

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion [Source: docs/stories/1.1.project-setup.md]:
- Python 3.13.5 virtual environment successfully created
- Poetry 2.1.4 dependency management configured
- Project structure follows monorepo pattern with packages/ml-core for ML operations
- Structured logging implemented using structlog
- Testing framework established with pytest and coverage reporting

### Data Models
Based on Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]:
- **SentimentAnalysis Model**: Core entity with sentiment_label (positive/negative/neutral), confidence_score (0.0000-1.0000), processing_time_ms
- **ModelVersion Model**: Tracks model metadata including huggingface_id, model_type (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa)
- Input validation should handle text_input with proper length constraints
- Output must include confidence scores and processing time for performance monitoring

### API Specifications
Based on API Specification [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]:
- REST API style with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- FastAPI framework for high-performance ML serving
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- Standardized error handling and response formats

### Component Specifications
Based on Components [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]:
- **ML Inference Engine Component**: Core sentiment analysis using transformer models
- **Technology**: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, Redis Caching
- Must integrate with existing logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Should follow service layer pattern for API calls

### File Locations
Based on Unified Project Structure [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Core Implementation**: `packages/ml-core/sentiment_pipeline.py`
- **Data Models**: `packages/ml-core/models.py`
- **Validation**: `packages/ml-core/validators.py`
- **Tests**: `tests/test_sentiment_pipeline.py`
- **Configuration**: `packages/ml-core/config.py`

### Testing Requirements
Based on Testing Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for core functionality
- **Testing Pyramid**: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- **Testing Tools**: Pytest, FastAPI TestClient
- **Test Location**: `tests/` directory at project root
- **Performance Testing**: Include timing assertions for sub-2-second requirement

### Technical Constraints
Based on Tech Stack [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ (required for ML ecosystem compatibility)
- **ML Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers (latest stable)
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch (latest stable)
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry 1.7+
- **Logging**: Structlog + Vercel (production-ready logging with ML context)
- **Performance**: Sub-2-second inference time on standard hardware

### Project Structure Notes
The architecture documents specify a clear separation between applications (apps/) and shared packages (packages/). The sentiment classification pipeline belongs in `packages/ml-core` as it's a core ML operation that will be consumed by both the web interface (apps/web) and API backend (apps/api). This follows the monorepo pattern and ensures code reusability across different application layers.

## Testing
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_sentiment_pipeline.py`
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for core functionality
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest with fixtures and coverage reporting
- **Test Categories**: Unit tests for pipeline logic, input validation, error handling, and performance benchmarks
- **Performance Testing**: Assert sub-2-second processing time requirement
- **Sample Data**: Include positive, negative, and neutral text examples for comprehensive testing
