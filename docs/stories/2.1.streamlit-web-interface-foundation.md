## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion [Source: docs/stories/1.4.basic-docker-containerization.md]:
- Docker containerization successfully implemented with CLI integration
- Container maintains sub-2-second inference time from Story 1.2
- CLI functionality fully working with analyze, batch, and info commands
- Testing framework established with >90% coverage requirement
- Container ready for web interface deployment

### Data Models
Based on Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]:
- **SentimentAnalysis Model**: Web interface must display sentiment_label, confidence_score, processing_time_ms
- **Input Validation**: Text input must respect 1000 character limit with proper error handling
- **Response Format**: Must show sentiment label, confidence percentage, and processing time
- **User Session**: Implement session state for analysis history and user preferences

### API Specifications
Based on API Specification [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]:
- Web interface will consume the sentiment pipeline directly (not through REST API yet)
- Use existing Pydantic models for input validation from `packages/ml-core/validators.py`
- Maintain consistency with error handling patterns established in previous stories
- Follow established logging and monitoring infrastructure

### Component Specifications
Based on Components [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]:
- **Frontend Web Component**: Primary responsibility for this story
- **Technology**: Streamlit 1.28+, Custom CSS, Tailwind CSS 3.3+
- **ML Inference Engine Component**: Must integrate with existing sentiment_pipeline.py
- **UI Components**: Create reusable components in packages/ui-components for future stories
- **State Management**: Use Streamlit Session State for simple state persistence

### File Locations
Based on Unified Project Structure [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Main App**: `apps/web/app.py` (new file)
- **UI Components**: `packages/ui-components/` (expand existing directory)
- **Integration**: Must use existing `packages/ml-core/sentiment_pipeline.py`
- **Configuration**: Use existing `packages/ml-core/config.py`
- **Testing**: `tests/test_web_interface.py` (new file)
- **Styling**: `apps/web/static/` (new directory for CSS and assets)

### Testing Requirements
Based on Testing Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for core functionality
- **Testing Pyramid**: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- **Testing Tools**: Pytest, Streamlit Testing, Playwright for E2E
- **Test Location**: `tests/` directory at project root
- **Frontend Testing**: Use Streamlit Testing framework for component testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for complete user workflow testing

### Technical Constraints
Based on Tech Stack [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ (required for ML ecosystem compatibility)
- **Frontend Framework**: Streamlit 1.28+ (latest stable version)
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for utility-first styling
- **State Management**: Streamlit Session State (built-in, no external dependencies)
- **UI Component Library**: Custom + Streamlit Components for professional aesthetic
- **Responsive Design**: Must work on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-2-second inference time from existing pipeline

### Project Structure Notes
The Streamlit web interface should be implemented in the `apps/web/` directory following the established project structure. It must integrate seamlessly with the existing sentiment pipeline from previous stories and maintain consistency with the established architecture. The interface should follow the microservices approach outlined in the high-level architecture, enabling future integration with the REST API and other components.

## Testing
- Test file location: `tests/test_web_interface.py` (new file)
- Test standards: >90% coverage for core functionality
- Testing frameworks: Pytest, Streamlit Testing, Playwright for E2E
- Testing pyramid: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- Focus on Streamlit components, sentiment analysis integration, and responsive design
- Test user interactions, error handling, and cross-browser compatibility
