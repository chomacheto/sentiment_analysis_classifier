## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion [Source: docs/stories/1.3.command-line-interface.md]:
- CLI successfully implemented with Click framework and comprehensive functionality
- Sentiment pipeline integration verified and working with sub-2-second inference time
- All CLI commands (analyze, batch, info) fully functional
- Testing framework established with >90% coverage requirement
- CLI entry point at `apps/ml_pipeline/cli.py` ready for containerization

### Data Models
Based on Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]:
- **SentimentAnalysis Model**: Container must support all model outputs (sentiment_label, confidence_score, processing_time_ms)
- **ModelVersion Model**: Container should handle model caching and versioning for consistent performance
- **Input Validation**: Container CLI must maintain same validation as local CLI (1000 character limit, proper error handling)

### API Specifications
Based on API Specification [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]:
- Container should maintain same validation patterns as local CLI
- Use existing Pydantic models for input validation
- Maintain consistency with error handling patterns
- Follow established logging and monitoring infrastructure

### Component Specifications
Based on Components [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]:
- **ML Inference Engine Component**: Container must integrate with existing sentiment_pipeline.py
- **Technology**: Should use same Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch stack
- Must integrate with existing logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Should follow service layer pattern for ML operations
- **Frontend Web Component**: Container should support future web interface deployment

### File Locations
Based on Unified Project Structure [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Dockerfile**: `Dockerfile` (new file at project root)
- **Docker Compose**: `docker-compose.yml` (new file at project root)
- **Container Scripts**: `scripts/docker/` (new directory for container utilities)
- **Integration**: Must use existing `apps/ml_pipeline/cli.py` and `packages/ml-core/sentiment_pipeline.py`
- **Configuration**: Use existing `packages/ml-core/config.py`
- **Documentation**: `docs/deployment/` (new directory for deployment docs)

### Testing Requirements
Based on Testing Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for core functionality
- **Testing Pyramid**: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- **Testing Tools**: Pytest, Docker testing utilities, container health checks
- **Test Location**: `tests/` directory at project root
- **Integration Testing**: Test container CLI integration with sentiment pipeline
- **Container Testing**: Test Docker build, run, and CLI functionality

### Technical Constraints
Based on Tech Stack [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ (required for ML ecosystem compatibility)
- **Container Technology**: Docker with multi-stage builds for optimization
- **ML Framework**: Must integrate with existing Hugging Face Transformers setup
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry 1.7+ (use existing project configuration)
- **Logging**: Structlog + Vercel (integrate with existing logging infrastructure)
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-2-second inference time from Story 1.2
- **Image Size**: Target <2GB final image size for deployment efficiency
- **Startup Time**: Sub-30-second container startup including model loading

### Project Structure Notes
The Docker containerization should be implemented at the project root level with Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files. It must integrate seamlessly with the existing CLI from Story 1.3 and maintain consistency with the established architecture. The container should follow the microservices approach outlined in the high-level architecture, enabling consistent deployment across different environments while maintaining the performance and functionality achieved in previous stories.

## Testing
- Test file location: `tests/test_docker.py` (new file)
- Test standards: >90% coverage for core functionality
- Testing frameworks: Pytest, Docker testing utilities, container health checks
- Testing pyramid: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- Focus on container build, CLI functionality, performance, and deployment
- Test container startup time and resource usage optimization
- Verify CLI integration with sentiment pipeline in containerized environment
