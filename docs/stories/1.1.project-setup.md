# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a properly configured development environment with all necessary dependencies,  
**so that** I can begin building the sentiment analysis functionality immediately.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Python 3.8+ virtual environment created with all ML dependencies (torch, transformers, streamlit, fastapi)
2. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore for Python ML projects
3. Basic project structure established with separate modules for models, data, api, and web interface
4. README.md created with clear setup instructions for development environment
5. Requirements.txt file lists all dependencies with version specifications
6. Basic logging configuration implemented for debugging and monitoring

### File Locations
Based on the Unified Project Structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md], the following directory structure must be created:
```
sentiment-analysis-classifier/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/           # Streamlit frontend
│   ├── api/           # FastAPI ML serving backend
│   └── ml-pipeline/   # Training and model management
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/        # Common types/utilities
│   ├── ml-core/       # Core ML operations
│   └── ui-components/ # Reusable UI components
├── infrastructure/     # IaC definitions
├── docs/              # Documentation (already exists)
└── scripts/           # Build/deploy scripts
```

### Testing Requirements
Based on Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: Create tests/ directory at project root
- Test standards: >90% coverage for core functionality
- Testing frameworks: Pytest, FastAPI TestClient, Playwright
- Testing pyramid: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests

### Technical Constraints
Based on Tech Stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Python version: 3.11+ (required for Streamlit compatibility)
- Dependency management: Poetry 1.7+ (modern Python packaging)
- Logging: Structlog + Vercel (production-ready logging with ML context)
- Build tool: Nx (monorepo management)

### Project Structure Notes
The architecture documents show a monorepo structure using Nx for workspace management. The project structure follows a clear separation between applications (apps/), shared packages (packages/), and infrastructure (infrastructure/).

## Testing
- Test file location: tests/ directory at project root
- Test standards: >90% coverage for core functionality
- Testing frameworks: Pytest, FastAPI TestClient, Playwright
- Testing pyramid: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- For this story: Focus on unit tests for logging configuration and dependency validation
