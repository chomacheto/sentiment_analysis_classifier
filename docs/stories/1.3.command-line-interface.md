## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion [Source: docs/stories/1.2.basic-sentiment-classification-pipeline.md]:
- Sentiment pipeline successfully implemented using Hugging Face transformers
- DistilBERT model with caching mechanism working correctly
- Input validation and error handling already implemented in core pipeline
- Performance optimization achieved sub-2-second inference time
- Testing framework established with >90% coverage requirement

### Data Models
Based on Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]:
- **SentimentAnalysis Model**: CLI must output sentiment_label (positive/negative/neutral), confidence_score (0.0000-1.0000), processing_time_ms
- **Input Validation**: CLI should handle text_input with proper length constraints
- **Output Format**: Must include all required fields from SentimentAnalysis model for consistency

### API Specifications
Based on API Specification [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]:
- CLI should follow similar validation patterns as the REST API
- Use Pydantic models for input validation where applicable
- Maintain consistency with API error handling patterns

### Component Specifications
Based on Components [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]:
- **ML Inference Engine Component**: CLI must integrate with existing sentiment_pipeline.py
- **Technology**: Should use same Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch stack
- Must integrate with existing logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Should follow service layer pattern for ML operations

### File Locations
Based on Unified Project Structure [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **CLI Entry Point**: `apps/ml_pipeline/cli.py` (new file)
- **CLI Commands**: `apps/ml_pipeline/commands/` (new directory)
- **Integration**: Must use existing `packages/ml-core/sentiment_pipeline.py`
- **Tests**: `tests/test_cli.py` (new test file)
- **Configuration**: Use existing `packages/ml-core/config.py`

### Testing Requirements
Based on Testing Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for core functionality
- **Testing Pyramid**: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- **Testing Tools**: Pytest, CLI testing with Click/Typer test utilities
- **Test Location**: `tests/` directory at project root
- **Integration Testing**: Test CLI integration with sentiment pipeline

### Technical Constraints
Based on Tech Stack [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ (required for ML ecosystem compatibility)
- **CLI Framework**: Click 8.0+ or Typer 0.9+ (modern Python CLI frameworks)
- **ML Framework**: Must integrate with existing Hugging Face Transformers setup
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry 1.7+ (use existing project configuration)
- **Logging**: Structlog + Vercel (integrate with existing logging infrastructure)
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-2-second inference time from Story 1.2

### Project Structure Notes
The CLI should be implemented in the `apps/ml_pipeline/` directory as it's a command-line tool for the ML pipeline. It must integrate seamlessly with the existing `packages/ml-core/sentiment_pipeline.py` to avoid code duplication and maintain consistency with the established architecture.

## Testing
- Test file location: `tests/test_cli.py` (new file)
- Test standards: >90% coverage for core functionality
- Testing frameworks: Pytest, Click/Typer testing utilities
- Testing pyramid: 70% Unit Tests, 20% Integration Tests, 10% E2E Tests
- Focus on CLI argument parsing, error handling, and integration with sentiment pipeline

#### Key Findings

1. **Test Coverage Critical Gap**: Overall coverage only 31% vs required 90%
2. **CLI Functionality Untested**: Core batch processing and error handling not covered (49% CLI coverage)
3. **Test Infrastructure Broken**: 12 test errors due to missing fixtures
4. **Validation Logic Issues**: 2 test failures in input validation

#### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: 3 high-severity issues preventing quality gate passage
- **Medium Risk**: 1 validation logic issue requiring attention
- **Critical Impact**: Story marked complete but fails basic quality standards

#### Required Actions

1. Fix test fixture setup to resolve all test errors
2. Increase test coverage to meet 90% requirement
3. Fix validation logic failures
4. Ensure comprehensive testing of all CLI functionality
