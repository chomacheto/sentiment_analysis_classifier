# Sentiment Analysis Classifier Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Create a production-ready sentiment analysis classifier that demonstrates modern NLP techniques for portfolio and interview purposes
• Enable rapid text sentiment classification with >85% accuracy using pre-trained Transformer models 
• Provide comprehensive learning path from basic usage to advanced fine-tuning and deployment
• Build an educational-to-production pipeline that bridges tutorial complexity with real-world applications
• Deliver automated sentiment insights at scale for businesses analyzing customer feedback and social media
• Showcase technical depth through end-to-end ML pipeline including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment

### Background Context

Manual sentiment analysis of large text datasets remains time-consuming, subjective, and inconsistent across organizations. Companies receive thousands of customer reviews, social media mentions, and feedback daily but lack efficient tools to understand sentiment trends. Traditional keyword-based approaches miss context, sarcasm, and nuanced emotional expressions, while commercial APIs are expensive for experimentation and learning.

The democratization of AI through pre-trained Transformer models and the Hugging Face ecosystem now enables production-quality sentiment analysis with minimal implementation complexity. This project addresses the gap between cutting-edge NLP research and practical application, serving both aspiring data scientists seeking portfolio projects and small businesses needing cost-effective sentiment analysis solutions.

### Branding

Modern, clean aesthetic with a subtle AI/tech theme using blues and greens to convey trustworthiness and innovation. Typography should be professional (system fonts for readability) with consistent spacing and visual hierarchy. Avoid overly flashy or gimmicky design elements that might detract from the technical focus - aim for "enterprise-ready" visual polish.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop/laptop experience for development workflow and interview demonstrations, with full mobile responsivity ensuring professional appearance across all devices. The interface should showcase responsive design skills while maintaining full functionality on smaller screens.
